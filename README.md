## Introduction

During my internship at Codsoft, I gained valuable experience in Data Science. I worked on various projects that helped me develop my skills and understanding of different machine learning techniques and libraries.

## Projects

### Titanic Survival

The Titanic Survival project focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. I utilized logistic regression and decision tree classifiers to build predictive models. The project aimed to analyze various factors contributing to the survival of passengers, such as age, gender, and ticket class.

### Iris Flower Detection

The Iris Flower Detection project involved classifying iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements. I applied machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and decision trees, to create a predictive model. The goal was to accurately classify new iris flower samples based on the learned patterns from the dataset.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. I utilized various algorithms, such as logistic regression and decision trees, to train models on a labeled dataset of credit card transactions. The objective was to build a robust fraud detection system that could accurately classify fraudulent transactions and minimize false positives.
